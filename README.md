# Go HTTP Server

This is a basic example of an HTTP server written in Go that responds with "Hello World" on the root route (`/`).

## Description

The HTTP server is implemented using Go's `net/http` package. When the root route (`/`) is accessed, the server responds with "Hello World from Go!". If any other route is accessed, a "Page not found" message is displayed.

## Requirements

- Go (version 1.16 or higher)

## Installation and Execution

### Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/go-http-server.git
   ```
## Future Improvements
- Add more routes and functionalities to the HTTP server.
- Implement a more advanced routing system.
- Add support for templates or views.
- Improve security and error handling.
